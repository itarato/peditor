Normal:
- comment coloring
- jump on search typing (allow fuzzy search)
- not-saved indicator on tabs/split panes
- help

Hard:
- LSP integration
- multiple cursors

Stupid:
- code execution / build configs
- line coloring/marking
- invent lines programming command
- visual feedback / popup

Bugfix:
- \" is tokenized in a string as a closing "
- horizontal scroll messes up syntax highlight markers
