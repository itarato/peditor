Normal:
- fuzzy file search on open
- comment coloring
- split window
- key re-binding (partially done, config file needed)
- help

Hard:
- LSP integration
- multiple cursors

Stupid:
- code execution / build configs
- line coloring/marking
- invent lines programming command
- visual feedback / popup

Bugfix:
