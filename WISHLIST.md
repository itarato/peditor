Normal:
- not-saved indicator on tabs/split panes
- git diff indicators (on sidelines)

Nice to have:
- help
- code execution / build configs
- line coloring/marking
- invent lines programming command
- visual feedback / popup


Hard:
- allow fuzzy search
- LSP integration
- multiple cursors

Bugfix:
