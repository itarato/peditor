Normal:
- git diff indicators (on sidelines)

Nice to have:
- help
- code execution / build configs -> how to see result? (panel? / output split unit)
- line coloring/marking
- invent lines programming command
- visual feedback / popup / bell

Big ones:
- allow fuzzy search (in source)
- LSP integration
- multiple cursors

Bugfix:
