Normal:
- word jumping navigation
- line numbers
- search
- file change detection
- remember column position
- line delete
- undo / redo
- open file
- line move
- help
- keep indentation on line feed

Hard:
- LSP integration

Stupid:
- code execution / build configs
- line coloring/marking

Bugfix:
- turn: `__cursor? = ?` to `setCursor?(?)` so scroll and all can be controlled
