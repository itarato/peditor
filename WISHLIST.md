Normal:
- help
- key re-binding

Hard:
- LSP integration
- tabs (multiple files)
- multiple cursors

Stupid:
- code execution / build configs
- line coloring/marking
- invent lines programming command
- visual feedback / popup

Bugfix:
- line move (indent or up/down) with selection -> when undo, the selection is not undone
    - maybe history should have selection + cursor location
